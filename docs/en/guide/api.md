Access the interactive API documentation generated by the backend:

- Swagger UI: [api/docs](api/docs)
- OpenAPI JSON: [api/openapi.json](api/openapi.json)

Replace the host with your production backend URL. You may expose `/api` behind a reverse proxy to keep consistent URLs across frontend and docs.
